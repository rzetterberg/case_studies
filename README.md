##What is this?

This is a collection of notes from different projects I have done. They will
serve as educational material with a practical approach. Hopefully someone will
find them interesting and learn something! 

Why I choose github is because I would like others to be able to make changes
easily if they find something to be wrong or have a better solution. 

##Notes

###1. Practical heapsort (C, gcc, linux, valgrind)

This note is about how I implemented heapsort instead of the existing
insertion sort to speed up sorting of statistical data points by date. The
application was written in C and compiled with gcc. I was using valgrind/callgrind
to check for memory leaks and to produce profiling information to use in
kcachegrind.

###3. 3D printing with Solidoodle 3 on GNU/Linux

This note is about how I have setup Slic3r and Pronterface on Debian to be able to use my 
Solidoodle 3. There are also some tips and tricks on 3D printing related tasks on Linux.
