#README

##What is this?

This is a collection of stories from different projects I have done. They will
serve as educational material with a practical approach. Hopefully someone will
find them interesting and learn something! 

Why I choose github is because I would like others to be able to make changes
easily if they find something to be wrong or have a better solution. 

##What type of projects?

Only projects I do on my spare time out of interest involving Linux, C, Haskell,
Python, electronics, AVR microcontrollers and Raspberry PI.

##Chapters

###1. Practical heapsort (C, gcc, linux, valgrind)

This chapter is about how I implemented heapsort instead of the existing
insertion sort to speed up sorting of statistical data points by date. The
application was written in C and compiled with gcc. I was using valgrind/callgrind
to check for memory leaks and to produce profiling information to use in
kcachegrind.
